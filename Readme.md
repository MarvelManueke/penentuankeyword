# Multi-label Classification model to determine keywords of a research articles
The model was deployed in heroku but moved to pythonanyhwere
http://penentuankeyword.pythonanywhere.com/
Limitation on the model :
1. The model was intended for research articles in Bahasa Indonesia and strictly for IT-related topics only. You can find Indonesian research articles on websites like Portal Garuda.
2. Before uploading, please ensure the file is in PDF format with the abstract on the first page.
3. For the best result you can use research articles from ejournal UNSRAT website since the model was built from it: https://ejournal.unsrat.ac.id/v3/index.php/elekdankom/issue/archive
4. For example https://ejournal.unsrat.ac.id/v3/index.php/elekdankom/article/view/47321
